# Server State branding
Server State is a FOSS project maintained by *Pablo Klaschka* and *Ludwig
Richter*, two students studying space- and aerospace computer science at the
University WÃ¼rzburg. The main goal is to provide a modular, extensible,
API-first, easy to use and customize application for monitoring the state of servers (or other network-connected machines). This can practically be any kind of server due to the modular approach, but we develop it primarily for monitoring web-like servers.

The resulting product is a high-level library for creating such a server
using NodeJS, meaning all the complicated aspects get handled by us while the
single thing end-users have to develop is a small instance that handles
configuration of the server (adding modules and running the server on a
specified port). This resulting server (application) might get based (or even 
using) the `simple-server` template to provide ease of use.

## Naming conventions
The official name of the product is *Server State*. In technical environments
not allowing for spaces, we should write *server-state*. 

> [!DANGER]
>
> To avoid any unfortunate associations with the initials of the name (which have bad
> associations with the NS time in Germany), it may **never** get referred to
> with its initials, i.e., as *SS*.

When we need an abbreviation, use *SerSta*, *SerState* or *SerS*.

## Colors
Except for the accent color, Server State uses tones of gray as a symbol of it
being a framework not specialized for any specific application, but modular.

Brand colors:
* `#e6e6e6`: Light
* `#b3b3b3`: Light gray
* `#808080`: Dark gray
* `#000000`: Dark
* `#008575`: Accent

## Logo
The Server State logo, designed by Ludwig Richter, looks like this:

![Server State Logo](logo/transparent/server-state_128x.png)

Depending on the background, there is also one with/for a dark background:

![Server State Logo Dark](logo/dark/server-state_128x.png)

and one for light backgrounds:

![Server State Logo Light](logo/light/server-state_128x.png)

The logo may get used as demonstrated here as long as the following rules get applied:

- the logo may not get modified in any way
- the logo must, in all areas, be distinct from its background. if this can not get achieved with the transparent version, use the one with a dark background on light backgrounds and vise-versa.
- the logo must always be fully visible. Rounded corners (and other obstructions) are acceptable when the main center shape does not thereby get obstructed.

The Logo assets can get found at https://github.com/server-state/specs/tree/master/branding/logo. 

## Fonts
As main font, we use [Libre Franklin](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Franklin).
