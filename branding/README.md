# Server State branding
Server State is a FOSS project currently maintained by *Pablo Klaschka* and *Ludwig
Richter*, two students studying space- and aerospace computer science at the
University WÃ¼rzburg. The main goal is to provide a modular, extensible,
API-first, easy to use and customize application for monitoring the state of servers (or other network-connected machines). This can practically be any kind of server due to the modular approach, but it is primarily developed for monitoring web-like servers.

The resulting product is a very high-level library for creating such a server
using NodeJS, meaning all the complicated aspects get handled by us while the
only thing clients have to develop is a small instance that handles
configuration of the server (adding modules and running the server on a
specified port). This resulting server (application) can be based (or even just
using) the `simple-server` template to provide ease of use.

## Naming conventions
The official name of the product is *Server State*. In technical environments
not allowing for spaces, it should be written as *server-state*. 

> [!DANGER]
>
> To avoid any unfortunate associations with the initials of the name (which have bad
> associations with the NS time in Germany), it may **never** be referred to
> with only its initials, i.e., as *SS*.

When an abbreviation is required, use *SerSta*, *SerState* or *SerS*.

## Colors
Except for the accent color, Server State uses tones of gray as a symbol of it
being a framework not specialized for any specific application, but modular.

Brand colors:

* `#b3b3b3`: Light gray
* `#808080`: Dark gray
* `#000000`: Dark
