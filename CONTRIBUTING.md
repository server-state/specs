# Contributing

Contributions to this project are always welcome. To keep everything consistent, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project.

### Contributing
If an issue exists for the task, please assign yourself in it and state when you begin and stop working on it to let everyone
know what you're working on/ what's not assigned yet.

Contributions may exist as PRs to the `develop` branch (and for hotfixes to the `master` branch). They have to get reviewed and merged by members of the GitHub organization.

#### As a member/maintainer of the core team
If you are a member of the core team (i.e., a member of the organization here on GitHub), you can contribute directly in this repository via a branch from the `develop` branch. While this is not enforced, please see the GitFlow workflow as a recommendation for contributions.

#### As an external contributor
If you are an external contributor, please fork the project and work locally in your account, and then create a PR following the guidelines above.
