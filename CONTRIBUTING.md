# Contributing

Contributions to this project are always welcome. To keep things consistent, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project.

### Contributing
If an issue exists for the task, please assign yourself in it and clearly state when you begin and stop working on it to let everyone
know what's being worked on/ what's not assigned yet.

Contributions may exist as PRs to the `develop` branch (and for hotfixes only to the `master` branch) only. They have to get reviewed and merged by members of the GitHub organization.

#### As a member/maintainer of the core team
If you are a member of the core team (i.e., a member of the organization here on GitHub), contributions may be done directly in this repository via a branch from the `develop` branch. While this is not enforced, please see the GitFlow workflow as a recommendation for contirbutions.

#### As an external contributor
If you are an external contributor, please fork the project and work locally in your account, and then create a PR following the guidelines above.
