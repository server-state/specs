# Data Formats (*DFs*) for the project

In the [generated type docs](https://server-state.github.io/types/modules/serverstate.dataformats.html) is a list of Common Data formats that we can use, allowing us to use standardized CBMs.

Ideally, all formats should include at least one implementation of a viewer in every Frontend implementation of *Server State*.
